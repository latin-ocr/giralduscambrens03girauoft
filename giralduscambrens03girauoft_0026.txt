xxii PREFACE.

The deficiency of other MSS. of the work is the more
to be regretted, as the one preserved in the Cotton Library
is written with extreme inaccuracy. In many places no
sense can be made: in others as little, except by having
recourse to violent alterations. To have stated all in-
stances of faulty reading, would have overloaded the page,
and needlessly swelled the work. It might be men-
tioned as an instance of this, and as proof of the extreme-
carelessness of the scribe, that the rubrics prefixed to the
chapters in the original, scarcely ever agree with those
prefixed to their proper books, andare full of the most
extraordinary blunders.

Obvious mistakes I have tacitly ventured to correct3 more
violent, and less obvious, alterations are noticed among
various readings3 some few passages have been left to the
ingenuity of the reader. But I have never ventured on
wauton corrections3 when a passage would yield tolera-
ble sense, I have been content to retain it3 though
convinced, it was not in the form in which it proceeded
from the author's pen. In this respect it would be
unjust in me not to acknowledge the very great benefit
I have received from the gentleman connected With the
press, to whom the reading of these sheets was en-
trusted. His suggestions have more than once enabled
me to see my way in a passage which Î™ had before
abandoned as hopelessly obscure and corrupted.

I have only further to add, that a chronological abstract

of the reign of Henry II. has been added for the con-
venience of the reader.
