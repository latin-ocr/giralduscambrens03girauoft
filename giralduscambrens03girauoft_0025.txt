PREFACE. x xi

Thus far, but no further than this, was Giraldus a
political opponent to Henry ΙΙ. and his successors; and
no further than this (as it seems to me) are we warranted
in drawing the conclusions of Bouquet and his Editors.

It has been already stated, that no copy of the first
edition of this work is now known to exist. Unfor-
tunately the remark may be further extended; for no
other MS. can be found than the one now preserved in
the Cotton Library, and from which the work is now
for the first time printed almost entire. I say almost

- entire, because the term applies strictly to the second

and third books which contain a connected view of the
reign of Henry IL, and may be considered as forming
a distinct treatise. It is for this reason that they stand
in prior order to the first book, which being for the
most part purely ethica]‚ or as the author himself describes
it, “per praecepta docens,” was little suited to the pur-
poses of the Society. All such passages, however, of the
first book as were of the least historica] interest, have
been placed in the Appendix.

Although this arrangement may appear in some respect
preposterous, yet it was thought to be more convenient,
and less likely to interrupt the continuity of the hist0ry3
especially as those passages of it which were deemed
worth preserving and printing, hare little or no connection
with the subject of the second and third books. If, how-
ever, the reader wishes to peruse the work iu its original
order, he should begin with the Appendix, and theu pro-

eeed with the second and third books in the order in

which they are printed.
