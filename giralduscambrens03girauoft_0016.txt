“Et quidem in Distinctione prima, longe ante alias

“pridem composita, scriptor studio a partium immunis,
“ agit de virtutibus quibus princeps instrui debet, ut con-

From the foregoing remarks it may be inferred that
the Editors of Bouquet’s Collection conceived that this
work of Giraldus had been composed at two different
times, and to suit two different purposes. They affirm
that the first book or Distinction (as it is called) wherein
the writer’s object is to show the various duties of princes,
was written long before the others (longe ante alias com-
posita); and they thereupon conclude that the other two
books were published at a much later period, in the reign
of King John, to encourage the Barons in their rebellion
against the King and his successor.

Both these assertions are important, and so intimately
connected, that one can hardly stand without the other.
There is also a strong appearance of probability in
them3 from the fact, that Giraldus often speaks against
the race of the Anjou princes in terms of unmeasured ἢ
reprobation. These passages are so numerous, that it
would occupy too much time to collect them here;
neither is it necessary, for the reader may see a particular
and sufficient instance in the twenty-seventh chapter of
the third book.

Two passages, however, are remarkable, and merit a
more particular notice. At the close of the chapter
just quoted, after observing that all insular people are sub-
ject to be governed by tyrants, according to the remark of
Boethius,¹ Giraldus proceeds to say, that, had the dominion

of France prospered in this country, as many desired that
