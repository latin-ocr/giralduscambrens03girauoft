PREFACE. xv

and, as such, was undoubtedly published after the death,
and not during the reign of King John. There is a pas-
sage towards the conclusion of the work, which leaves no
doubt upon this head. ¹ To this second edition only, and
not to the first, are we indebted for such passages as
contain the severest reprobation of this King's character
and conduct3 and hence many events are recorded, and
opinions are expressed, inconsistent with other portions of
the work.

If the remarks, therefore, of the Editors of Bouquet be

. well founded, they can refer only to the first and not to the

second edition—and of that first edition no copy is known
to exist. Were it true that Giraldus in composing this
work had a politica] object in view,—that he wrote with
the sole intention of blackening the character of the
Anjou princes, and assisting the party of the Barons,
he would have ill secured his object by publishing his
work at the time when the prince whom he most con-
demned was beyond the reach of his reproof.

If again it be contended that the remarks of the French
Editors might at least apply with propriety to the first,
if not to the second edition, it is replied, that the pas-
sages on which their remark is founded were in all pro-
bability inserted only in the second edition, and did not
occur in the first. How else ean we reconcile the apparent
contradictions in the author's words and opinions? How,
for instance, on any other supposition could he pray
in one part of his work, that King John might belong
