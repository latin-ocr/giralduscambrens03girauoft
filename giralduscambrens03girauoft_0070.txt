30 GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS

tente, (filius enim plus omnino dilectus extiterat,¹ pater
vero adeo cunctis infestus et exosus, quod si Martis alea
processisset a finibus propriis in primo conflictu, sicut
postea scitum est et compertum, filio captivus traderetur 3)
filius, inquam, interim lethali morbo correthS‚ intra
paucissimos dies, soluta, proh dolor ! tanta per interemptio-
nem contentione3 cum exercitus utriusque dolore non
modico, vir virtutis invictae morte praematura circa kalendas
J unii victus occubuit.2

Patri vero prae omnibus incomparabili moerore tantus
dolor et tam immoderatus accessit,3 quod solatium re-
spuens omne, inter duo mala perpleXUS‚ longe maluerit

filium de se quam mortem de filio triumphasse.4

¹ Such is the unanimous state-
ment of the writers of this pc-
riod.

² AD. 1183. “iii. idus Junii,
in festivitate beati Barnabae apos-
toli.’' Appendix Roberti dc
Monte, p. 335, cd. Bouq. The
same writer, who gives a more de-
tailed account of this Prince's
death, laments over him with the
affection of a friend. After some
disputo, his body was taken up and
buried in the cathedr-al of Rouen.
Compare also the Chron. Retho-
magense, ib. p. 3573 and the
Chron. Laudun. ib. 7043 Chron.
Voss. in Labbe, ii. p. 3383 and
the letter of Peter ofBlois to Queen
Eleanor, on occasion of her son's
funeral. Opera Bles. p. 250.

³ His grief was the greater, be-
cause his son, repenting on his
death-bed of his disobedience, ear-
nestly entreated of his father, as a
last favour, to come and visit him.
But the King, though his bowcls
were moved with compassion (as
the Chronicler says), was dissuaded
by his eounscllors from this visit,
who were apprehensive of danger to
his person. He therefore sent his
son, a ring, in sign of his forgiveness,
which the Prinee upon receiving,
reverently kissed and soon after

breathed his last.
p. 507.
⁴ On his death-bed hc wrote a

Hemingford,

letter to his father, the contents of
which are preserved by the Prior
of Vigeois.

He headed his epistle with this
passage from the Psahns 2 “ Delicta
mea et ignorantias meus ηε memi-
neris.’' After entreating his father
to treat his mother with kindness,
who had now been a prisoner at
Salisbury upwards of ten years, he
besought him to provide for his
widow Margaret, the daughter of
the French King. He then pro-
ceeded to request of him ‘to make
peace with the people of Limogcs
and the neighbouring states, to rc-
pair whatever injurios had been
committed in the war, and to re-
store their treasures to the churches.

As some satisfaction for his own
ill-conduct, he desired that his eyes,
brains, and entrails should be laid
at the feet of the Apostle, until
such reparation had been made.
Labbe, Bib. MSS. ii. 339.

I have referred the more fre-
quently to this and other Chronielers
of foreign growth, because they
supply many desects, and have been
often neglected by our English his-
torians.
