qui ab ipso transcriberetur3 et si non propter aliud,
propter versus duos quos in adventu viri sancti, quasi
pronostico quodam, tunc legebat praescriptos3 sc., qui
fortunae martiris expresse conveniebant. Propter quod, his
auditis, et librum a manibus ejus statim assumens, ipsum
transcribi fecit. Hos quoque versus ibidem invenies ε

Di mihi dent, et tu, quae tu Trojane mereris,
Di mihi dent, et tu, quae volo si merui.¹

¹ A similar anecdote of S. Tho-
mas is narrated by Fordun, in his
Scotichronicon. “ When Thomas,'’
he says, “was secking safcty by
flight, early one morning, as hc
was walking alone, and meditating
on the sadness of his condition, 116
was met by a certain clerk. ‘ Whi-
ther away 2’ 116 inquired. ‘ Ι am
going‚’ quoth the scholar, ‘to school
at Canterbury. For I have heard,'
116 continued, ‘that it pleases our
noble Archbishop to maintain poor
scholars. I have hopes therefore
of finding support under the wings
of his fatherly affection and good-
ness3 for I am but a poor orphan,
and have no means of supporting
myself.' ‘ And what book art thou
reading, my son,' replied the Arch—
shop, kindly, ‘and where is thy
lesson 2 ’ ‘ Cato,' answered thc

scholar; ‘and here is my les-
son—

‘ Esto animoflirtis cum sis dam-

natus inique?

Thc Saint took the verse for an
omen, as a message of comfort from
Almighty God3 and telling the
clc1·k‚ that, when 116 next saw the
Archbishop, he should approach
him with confidenee, and, asking
his charity, show this verse, for a
tokcn, 116 gave him some money ;
and they separated with mutual
cornfort.'’ Lib. viii. 18.
