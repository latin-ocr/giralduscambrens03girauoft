viii PREFACE.

had every facility for ascertaining the truth of what
he has narrated respecting the death of the King, and
the cause of his dissension with his sons,--means for
ascertaining the truth, such as no author possessed at the
time,

At p. 63 of this work, he details a conversation which he
held with Henry H. respecting aid for the Holy Land3
at p. 114, a confidential discourse with the celebrated
Ranulphus de Glanvilla, the most potent nobleman of
this reign, one especially trusted by the King and em-
ployed in the most delicate negotiations3 and for some
years he was the daily companion of Archbishop Baldwin.

Of his competency, therefore, to form a due estimate
of the reign of Henry IL, there can be no question.
He possessed the best possible means of arriving at full
and correct information 3 living at the very time, and in the
very theatre of the events which he narrates 3 and enjoying
familiar intercourse with those who had been the chief
actors in them. Employed about the King and his sons,
he was able to speak from personal observation of their
character and person, and to supply many anecdotes‚
unknown to the majority of writers, on the authority of
those who had all their lives been employed about the
Court.

As might with reason be expected in a writer thus fa-
voured, the work before the reader contains details not to be
met with elsewhere3 more especially those which are of a
personal character. Some anecdotes, more briefly noticed
by other chroniclers, are given here in detail 3 others in a
more lively style, or with a simplicity peculiar to an eye
and ear witness. Of the former class are his statelnents

rcspecting King Henry’s impatience under his troubles3
