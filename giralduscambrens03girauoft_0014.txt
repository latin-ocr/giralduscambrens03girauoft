X PREFACE.

“ applicando, librum de Principis Ire-structione, multis auc-
“toritatibus tam philosophicis quam theologiciS, per ex-
“ empla pariter et praecepta, studioso labore compagina-
“ tum, longisque lucubrationibus elaboratum edere curavi.”
—p. 442.

To these passages one other shall be added, as reference
will be made to it hereafter: “Liber de Principis
“Instructione toties promissus, fere inter primos inchoa-
“ tus, inter ultimos autem propalatus, diu nimium
“ clausus et sopitus, quando tute prodire posset plurimis
“ annorum curriculis tempus expectans, liberaliter quidem
“ et non livide legenti labor sua quoque laude non indig-
“ nuS.''——Catalogus brevior librorum suorum, p. 446.

An author like Giraldus, whose life had been chequered
by such varied scenes, who had frequently visited Paris
and Rome, had studied for years in both cities, had been
employed in negotiations of the most delicate nature,
and enjoyed the most intimate acquaintance with contempo-
rary statesmen and prelates, in penning a work like the
present, and reviewing the soenes of his past life, could
scarcely fail of committing to paper events and anecdotes
interesting to the general reader, and most important to
the scholar employed in historical investigations.

It is then no matter of surprise, that the publication
of the work should have been anxiously expected
by persons fully competent to judge of its merits,¹
or that the Editors of the French Historical Collec-
tion should have so far departed from their plan, as to
insert in their great work more copious abstracts from it.

Before closing this preface, it will be proper to allude

in his Ang‘lo—Norman Biography.
