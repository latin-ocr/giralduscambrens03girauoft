22 GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS

antea fuerat occultus, effectus postea manifestus, non
mundi quidem rosa juxta falsam et frivolam nominis im-
positionem, sed inmundi verius rosa vocata, palam et im-
pudentius abutendo 3¹ et quoniam componitur orbis Regis
ad exemplum, non solum facto, quin immo longe magis
offendit exemplo.

Ad haec etiarn, ut adhuc ex multis pauca proponam,
circa prima regni sui tempora, Regi Francorum Ludowico
super aggrediendam communiter peregrinationem Hiero-
solimitanam fidei sacramentique vinculo constrictus ; et ab
eodem Rege multotiens ad hoc invitatus, saepissime quidem
suasorie provocatus, semper distulit, semper in tempus
protelavit. Erat enim dilator in omnibus, et in his etiam
quae motu ultroneo votivoque desiderio facere disposuerat3
sicut ex litteris de compromissione eorundem et confedera-
tione, compositis, et hic insertis, palam esse potest.2

death-bed, requested her liberation
in very earnest ternis ; but the King,
though inconsolable for the loss of
his son⁷ did not think fit to eom-
ply with this request. In trudi, it
was not till after twelve years'
imprisonment, and the interces-
sion of Baldwin, Archbishop of
Canterbury⁷ that the rigor of her
confinement was somewhat abated.
(Gerv. 1475.) The Kingpretended,
as a cause for this eruel detention',
the countenanee she gave to her
sons in their rebellion against hi1n3
but this was not the only cause.
See the authorities already quoted,
especially Ger-vase of Canterbury,
who says of her7 “ Erat prudens fc-
mina, valde'nohilibus orta natalibus,
sed instabilis.’' There ean be little

doubt of the correctness of the last
epithet.

¹He alludes to the epigram
made on her name :

“Hicjaoet in ΐαηῑόα Rosa mundi,
mm Rosa munda ;

N on pidil’c’t’ scd olet, quae redolere

² Geoffiey, the Prior of Vigeois
(vosiensis), in his ehroniele, adds
some circumstances to this pilgrim-
age not generally notieed by our
English writers.

He tells us that the King upon
eonversing with his confessor, a
Norman bishop, was told that if he
would become a huinble pilgrim‚
and visit S. Thomas of Canter-
bury, he might expect to recover
his peace with God. The King
replied that he would go if
his confessor would go with him.
“I will go willingly‚” says the
bishop. They crossed the sea, and
visited the shrine. The King pass-
ed the night in prayer and fasting3
and was rewarded for his piety by
a sign from the Martyr. As he
was retiring in the morning after
Mass, a messenger met him, say--
ing, “Rejoiee, King of England!
victory is given thee from Heaven.
Thy servant Manzer (2) has van-
quished the King of the Seots, who
was yesterday committed to prison.’ '
